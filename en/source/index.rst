Behat Documentation
======================

Background
----------

Behat is an `open source <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/MIT/>`_ `behavior driven development <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development>`_ framework for php 5.3.

Behat was inspired by Ruby's `Cucumber <http://cukes.info/>`_ project and especially it's syntax part (Gherkin). It tries to be like Cucumber with input (Feature files) and output (console formatters).

After installation, read this great articles about BDD:

* `Dan North's "What's in a Story?" <http://dannorth.net/whats-in-a-story/>`_
* `Cucumber's "Backgrounder" <https://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/wiki/Cucumber-Backgrounder>`_

Although both tutorials are Cucumber-specific, you’ll soon learn that Behat shares much with Cucumber! Once you’ve finished reading these tutorials, move on to the following topics.
